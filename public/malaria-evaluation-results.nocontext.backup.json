      "answer": "### Direct answer\nExchange transfusion may be considered in severe falciparum malaria with hyperparasitemia to rapidly reduce parasite load; however, in pregnancy, it carries significant risks and is not routinely recommended. Indications include very high parasitemia with severe complications unresponsive to antimalarials. Benefits are rapid parasite clearance; risks include volume overload, alloimmunization, and complications to mother and fetus.\n\n### Evidence\n- Pregnant women with falciparum malaria, especially in second/third trimesters, have high risk of severe disease with complications such as hypoglycemia and pulmonary edema.  \n- Severe malaria in pregnancy has ~50% maternal mortality; fetal death and premature labor are common.  \n- Treatment of severe malaria must be immediate with parenteral artesunate or alternatives; no specific mention of exchange transfusion as standard care.  \n- No direct evidence on exchange transfusion indications, benefits, or risks in pregnancy provided.  \n- Pregnancy increases vulnerability to severe malaria and associated complications such as severe maternal anemia and placental malaria, which may worsen outcomes.\n\n### Missing\n- Specific guidelines or evidence on exchange transfusion use in pregnancy with hyperparasitemia.  \n- Data on maternal and fetal safety profile of exchange transfusion during pregnancy.  \n- Threshold parasitemia levels warranting exchange transfusion in pregnancy.\n\n### Summary\nWhile exchange transfusion can rapidly reduce parasite burden in severe malaria with hyperparasitemia, it is not standard or routinely recommended in pregnancy due to lack of safety data and high maternal-fetal risks.
